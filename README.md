Set all Spotify playlists on your profile to public or private with one click.


Helps those who decide to be more open or more private with the music they listen to. 

Personally saved me hours of tedious time compared to switching the visibility of hundreds of individual playlists.

*Just uploaded to backup code. If you want to use this program make a spotify app on their developer portal, and put in your app details in the app.py file.
